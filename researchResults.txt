Week of 5 Mar to 11 Mar

Total gain loss of $482
With a target of >=$15 per side and missing positoins made up: Potential of $476 difference
Total gain loss would have been about $958 if premium was targeted rather than delta.
This may also have better guarenteed other side position openings


Week of 14 Mar to 18 Mar

Total loss of $-1326
With target of >=$15 and missing positions: Diff of $565 and total loss of $-761.



All time (can't run script for all time because it's difficult to come up with other side)

Total potential difference: $1041
Total gain/loss: 958 + -761 = $197
  - Not great, but definitely better than the current loss of $-854 since 7 Mar
