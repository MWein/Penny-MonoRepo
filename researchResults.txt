Week of 5 Mar to 11 Mar

Total gain loss of $482
With a target of >=$15 per side and missing positoins made up: Potential of $476 difference
Total gain loss would have been about $958 if premium was targeted rather than delta.
This may also have better guarenteed other side position openings


Week of 14 Mar to 18 Mar

Total loss of $-1326
With target of >=$15 and missing positions: Diff of $565 and total loss of $-761.



All time (can't run script for all time because it's difficult to come up with other side)

Total potential difference: $1041
Total gain/loss: 958 + -761 = $197
  - Not great, but definitely better than the current loss of $-854 since 7 Mar


UPDATE 3/25

Looks like going after the spread price rather than the delta worked out.
At the present moment I'm looking at $832 of profit. We'll see how it pans out tomorrow.

New idea
Looking purely at delta and accepting $7 per spread screwed me.
The losses overcame the wins by a lot.
I can run a parallel strategy that can hedge my losses.
I can buy into the $7ish spreads while simultanously selling $15+ spreads.
It would increase my losses probably most of the time but if a black swan event occurs, the long positions would basically cancel out the losses.
Last week, the losses stood at around $1300 but most positions were $7, most losses at ~$80-100
If I run both strategies simultanously, I could potentially decrease the losses.
Easy experiment to run. If it doesn't work I can identify the long positions and ignore them when calculating profit/loss on the sold spreads.
Lets code that out this weekend!


Backtest results

A backtest was run to see the value of the positions if they were all long.
A cursory glance shows that if the long portions of the spreads were purchased by themselves, they would be profitable basically every day after they were purchased...

Long legs:
2022-03-21 -651
2022-03-22 777
2022-03-23 2060
2022-03-24 1430

Short legs (Because these were sold, negative is good):
2022-03-21 538
2022-03-22 -841
2022-03-23 -1916
2022-03-24 -1173
2022-03-25 0


On the day they were purchased, they would cumulatively be at a loss.
But every day afterwards they are at profit.

The cost basis for the long legs are: $3977
Short legs: $5646

So if sold on the 23rd (wed), the percent profit would be
51% for longs
33% for shorts

If this is repeatable, which I believe it is, then this might be the entire new strategy.
Which would also mean that I have no early assignment risk and my max loss is essentially the theta decay.
Obviously, this needs a few more weeks to verify but this... this is exciting.

Update: A thought occurs. Those rediculous numbers could be driven by just a handful of stocks.
BABA rallied like crazy this week, for example. I have a feeling that it makes up the bulk of the number I'm seeing.
However, if it's more distributed, that could still mean a good profit number.

Update 2: Yup. It's being driven almost entirely by GME :'(

A secondary experiment should be run with long straddles. That would cost more but potentially bring in more. Idk.
